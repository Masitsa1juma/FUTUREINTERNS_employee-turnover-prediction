# Employee Turnover Prediction Model

This project aims to build a predictive model to anticipate which employees are likely to leave the company based on historical data.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `HR_comma_sep.csv`, which contains various features related to employee satisfaction and performance.

 Steps Involved

1. Data Preparation
   - Loaded the dataset.
   - Explored the data for insights.
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values and duplicates.
   - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
   - Engineered additional features as needed.

2. Model Selection
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Selected Logistic Regression and Random Forest as classification algorithms.
   - Trained both models on historical data.

3. Model Evaluation
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Visualized results for comparison.
 Results

The evaluation metrics are displayed in bar charts comparing both models' performance.
